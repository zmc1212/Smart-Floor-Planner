# Native Workflow (B0-B3)

Pure workflow core plus a B-owned draft/publish store for 家客来 native business
orchestration. B0-B2 defines, validates, compiles and simulates workflows; B3
adds drafts, immutable published versions and a simulation debugging surface.
It does **not** connect a model, business database, queue, scheduler, existing
Worker, business write path or message channel.

Owner: B line (`codex/xiaok-native-workflow`). Shared migrations, dependencies,
menus, the sole XiaoK plan and the bilingual module inventories' integration
wiring remain owned by the integration lead.

## Boundary

- The pure core imports only Node built-ins and local files in this directory.
- Importing the module never starts jobs, timers, workers or network calls.
- B3 storage is a B-owned file store under `admin/tmp/native-workflow-store`
  (override with `NATIVE_WORKFLOW_STORE_DIR`); it is not a shared migration.
- Never reads production keys, customer data or real receipts.
- Simulated saves/deliveries are proposals with `simulated: true`; they must
  never be presented as generated, saved or sent to a customer.
- Real capability adapters (authorized reads, model compose, persistence,
  in-app outbox) are B4 work behind the same `PendingOperation` descriptions.

## Public API (`index.ts`)

| Function | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `validateDefinition(raw)` | Structure, capability whitelist, references, dominance, type compatibility, edge legality, cycle/bounds and import safety. |
| `compileDefinition(raw)` | Validates, then returns an immutable plan with digest, node versions, outgoing edges, topological order and bounds. |
| `advance(plan, state, event)` | Pure transition. Accepts `start` or `observation`; returns a new state, trace entries and pending operation descriptions only. Version-bound to the plan digest. |
| `simulate({ definition, scenario, fixtures })` | Drives `advance` with fixture observations. Deterministic for the same definition/scenario/fixtures. |
| `parseDefinitionJson` / `exportDefinitionJson` | Canonical import/export with one shared size rule, forbidden-content and schema checks. |
| `createStageReminderDefinition` / `createPeriodReportDefinition(kind)` | The two templates. |

B3 exports:

| Module | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `createWorkflowService({ store, now? })` | Template drafts, optimistic draft saves, validate/compile publishing, fixed-revision simulation and fixture compatibility. |
| `createFileWorkflowStore({ rootDir })` / `createMemoryWorkflowStore()` | Store interface implementations with atomic draft conflicts and append-only versions. |
| `fixtureSets` / `fixtureSetSummaries` | Built-in normal and failure fixtures for both templates. |

Supporting exports: `definitionDigest`, `capabilityCatalog`, `getCapability`,
`createRunState`, `WORKFLOW_BOUNDS`.

## Definition contract

- Root: `schemaVersion` (1), `definitionId`, `revision`, `entryNodeId`,
  `inputSchema`, `nodes`, `edges`.
- Node: `nodeId`, `type`, `typeVersion` (1), `capabilityRef`, `config`, `inputs`.
  Inputs are references `{ nodeId, outputPath }`; there are no literal inputs.
- Edge: `{ from, to, when? }`. `when` is only valid on `condition` edges and is
  unique per branch. Non-condition nodes have at most one outgoing edge.
- Bounds: 32 nodes, 64 edges, 16 input mappings per node, 64 KB canonical
  definition JSON (one rule shared by import and export), 512 KB raw import
  text, scan depth 32, 10,000 scanned values, 64 execution steps.
- Entry must be the only trigger, have one unconditional outgoing edge and no
  incoming edge. All nodes must be reachable. `save_result`/`deliver_inapp`
  nodes may be terminal; every save needs a path to a delivery node. Cycles,
  duplicate nodes/edges, unknown nodes/capabilities, missing outputs, type
  mismatches and forward references are rejected.
- Input references reject self-references and non-mandatory sources. A source
  must dominate the consumer (every path from the entry passes through it).
  Common pre-branch sources are allowed; a source available on only one branch
  after a merge is rejected with `input_not_mandatory`.
- Capability names, input ports, output ports, required inputs and template
  placeholders use own-property whitelists. Inherited names such as
  `constructor` or `toString` are never treated as contract entries.
- Imported JSON may not contain URLs, SQL, code/`require`/`import()`, secrets,
  file paths, `${...}` expressions or unknown transport fields. The safety scan
  is depth- and size-bounded and reports `scan_depth_exceeded`,
  `scan_nodes_exceeded` or `cyclic_structure` instead of overflowing the stack.

## Six controlled node types

| Type | Capability refs | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trigger` | `trigger.stage_changed`, `trigger.period_report` | none (event payload) |
| `read_materials` | `read.project_context`, `read.enterprise_craft`, `read.period_records`, `read.authorized_photos`, `read.receiver_scope` | host read |
| `condition` | `condition.compare_boolean`, `condition.compare_number`, `condition.compare_text` | none |
| `compose_content` | `compose.stage_reminder_deterministic` (no model), `compose.stage_reminder_model`, `compose.period_report` | none / model compose |
| `save_result` | `save.stage_reminder`, `save.period_report` | host save |
| `deliver_inapp` | `deliver.inapp` | host in-app outbox |

Identity (enterprise, user, project, lease, permission) is supplied by the host.
Graph definitions cannot override it. There is no external WeChat/SMS/email
capability. A graph can never assert engineering acceptance.

## State and advance

`createRunState(plan, { runId, mode })` creates `running`, and `advance`:

1. Before handling any event, the state's `definitionId`, `revision` and
   `digest` must match the compiled plan. Cross-version continuation throws
   `run_definition_mismatch`; a published revision is never silently reused.
2. `start` validates the trigger event against `inputSchema`, records the event
   ID, stores trigger outputs and pumps deterministic nodes until a host effect
   or a terminal state.
3. `observation` matches the pending node, validates all declared output ports
   and their types, stores only declared outputs, then pumps.
4. `pending` contains at most one descriptive operation (`nodeVersion`,
   resolved input, `simulation` marker, idempotency key). No effect is executed.
5. Observation outputs, run state and pending inputs are deep-copied at their
   boundaries; later edits to caller-owned JSON cannot mutate earlier snapshots.
   Observation values must be finite JSON (no cycles, `Date`, functions or
   non-finite numbers); violations fail with `invalid_observation` before any
   deep clone runs.
6. Save/delivery observations must confirm `saved`/`delivered` is `true` and
   carry a receipt with a `receiptId`; simulation receipts must also be marked
   `simulated: true`. `saved: false`, `delivered: false`, a missing/invalid
   receipt or an unmarked simulation receipt fails the run with
   `save_not_confirmed`, `delivery_not_confirmed`, `invalid_receipt` or
   `receipt_not_simulated` and never completes it.
7. Failures become `failed` with the original error; unmatched condition
   branches become `halted`; a validated terminal save/delivery becomes
   `completed`.

Duplicate event IDs are ignored before any operation is produced. Terminal runs
reject new events except a duplicate of the processed event.

## Simulation

```ts
simulate({
  definition,
  scenario: { runIdPrefix, clock: { startedAt, stepMs }, events },
  fixtures: { nodes: { [nodeId]: { status: 'ok', outputs } | { status: 'failed', error } } },
});
```

- Time, event IDs and generation results are explicit inputs; the core never
  reads `Date.now()` or generates IDs.
- Duplicate events across the scenario are reported in `duplicateEventIds` and
  produce no second run.
- Failures are injected per node and surfaced with their own codes. A missing
  fixture fails with `fixture_missing`.
- Save/delivery fixtures follow the same core semantics: false confirmations
  fail with `save_not_confirmed`/`delivery_not_confirmed`, invalid receipts fail
  with `invalid_receipt`, and a fixture claiming a real receipt fails with
  `receipt_not_simulated`. Valid receipts are stamped with `simulated: true`.
- Every trace entry is marked `mode: 'simulation'`.
- `dailyReportFixtures` keeps daily records inside the daily period and uses a
  daily title; weekly fixtures keep raw records inside the weekly period.

## Templates

1. `stage-reminder`: stage trigger → project context → known-stage gate →
   subscription gate → authorized craft read → knowledge switch → model or
   deterministic compose → save reminder → in-app delivery. Unknown stages halt;
   knowledge off keeps the zero-model deterministic branch; duplicate stage
   events are ignored.
2. `period-report-daily` / `period-report-weekly`: one shared `period` contract;
   raw period records and authorized photos are read directly. Weekly never
   consumes model-written dailies as source facts. Missing records/photos are
   expressed by compose output; zero receivers saves the report but stops
   before delivery.

## B3 drafts, published versions and debugging

- `createWorkflowService` creates drafts from `stage-reminder`,
  `period-report-daily` and `period-report-weekly`.
- Draft saves require `expectedDraftRevision`; stale writes return
  `draft_conflict` (HTTP 409) with `currentDraftRevision`. Saves run
  `validateDefinition` and force the route `definitionId` plus the next
  `revision`.
- Publishing re-runs `validateDefinition` and `compileDefinition`, then stores
  an append-only version with digest, normalized definition, node versions and
  timestamp. Re-publishing unchanged content returns the existing version;
  editing the draft is required before a new version is created.
- Published versions are read-only. A simulation can run the current draft or a
  fixed published revision, so later edits never change an older trace.
- Storage defaults to a B-owned file store (`admin/tmp/native-workflow-store`,
  override `NATIVE_WORKFLOW_STORE_DIR`). The store interface allows a Postgres
  adapter later; the file adapter assumes a single admin process. No shared
  migration is added here.
- Admin surface: `/native-workflow` (list/create) and
  `/native-workflow/[definitionId]` (draft JSON, versions, simulation trace).
  The page and `/api/native-workflow/**` require platform `super_admin`/`admin`.
  Menus are not modified in this round.
- Fixtures cover normal, knowledge-off, duplicate-event, read-denied,
  compose/save/delivery failures, material withdrawal and no-receiver cases.
- No drag canvas is added: no confirmed canvas design was found, so this round
  ships the main page, key states, structured definition editing and traces.

## Reproduce

From `admin/` (no database, no Worker, no model):

```powershell
npx tsx --test src/lib/native-workflow/__tests__/validate.test.ts src/lib/native-workflow/__tests__/advance.test.ts src/lib/native-workflow/__tests__/simulate.test.ts src/lib/native-workflow/__tests__/hardening.test.ts src/lib/native-workflow/__tests__/store.test.ts src/lib/native-workflow/__tests__/service.test.ts
npx tsx src/lib/native-workflow/playground/simulate.ts
```

Fixtures are synthetic and contain no real customer data.
